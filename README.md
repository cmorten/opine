# opine

Fast, minimalist web framework for [Deno](https://deno.land/) ported from [ExpressJS](https://github.com/expressjs/express).

![Test](https://github.com/asos-craigmorten/opine/workflows/Test/badge.svg) [![deno doc](https://doc.deno.land/badge.svg)](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/x/opine/mod.ts)

```ts
import opine from "https://deno.land/x/opine@master/mod.ts";

const app = opine();

app.use((req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World");
});

app.listen({ port: 3333 });
```

## Installation

This is a [Deno](https://deno.land/) module available to import direct from this repo and via the [Deno Registry](https://deno.land/x).

Before importing, [download and install Deno](https://deno.land/#installation).

> Please refer to the [version file](./version.ts) for a list of Deno versions supported by Opine.
>
> Once Deno is installed, you can easily switch between Deno versions using the `upgrade` command:
>
> ```bash
> # Upgrade to latest version:
> deno upgrade
>
> # Upgrade to a specific version, replace `<version>` with the version you want (e.g. `1.0.0`):
> deno upgrade --version <version>
> ```

You can then import Opine straight into your project:

```ts
import opine from "https://deno.land/x/opine@master/mod.ts";
```

If you want to use a specific version of Opine, just modify the import url to contain the version:

```ts
import opine from "https://deno.land/x/opine@0.3.0/mod.ts";
```

Or if you want to use a specific commit of Opine, just modify the import url to contain the commit hash:

```ts
import opine from "https://deno.land/x/opine@c21f8d6/mod.ts";
```

## Features

- Robust routing
- Focus on high performance
- HTTP helpers

And more to come as we achieve feature parity with [ExpressJS](https://github.com/expressjs/express).

## Philosophy

The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.

Opine will aim to achieve these same great goals, focussing first on developing robust tooling and features before moving onto accelerating performance and becoming super lightweight.

As time passes, Opine's goals may naturally diverge from [ExpressJS](https://github.com/expressjs/express) and this will be reflected here.

## Examples

To run the [examples](./examples), you have two choices:

1. Run the example using Deno directly from GitHub, for example:

    ```bash
    deno run --allow-net --allow-read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asos-craigmorten/opine/master/examples/hello-world/index.ts
    ```

1. Clone the Opine repo locally:

    ```bash
    git clone git://github.com/asos-craigmorten/opine.git --depth 1
    cd opine
    ```

    Then run the example you want:

    ```bash
    deno --allow-net --allow-read ./example/hello-world/index.ts
    ```

All the examples contain helper commands in the comments of their `index.ts` file to help get you started for either method.
