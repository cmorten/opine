## Reporting a Bug

The Opine team and community take all security bugs in Opine seriously. Thank
you for improving the security of Opine. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the lead maintainer in the
[CODEOWNERS](./.github/CODEOWNERS.md) file.

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email, and will send a response
indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to
your report, the maintainer team will endeavor to keep you informed of the
progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional
information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the maintainer team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to
a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

- Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
- Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
- Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. These fixes will be
  released as fast as possible to GitHub.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
pull request.
