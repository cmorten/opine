# 0.x API

Adapted from the [ExpressJS API Docs](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html).

## Request

The `req` object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on. In this documentation and by convention, the object is always referred to as `req` (and the HTTP response is `res`) but its actual name is determined by the parameters to the callback function in which you're working.

For example:

```ts
app.get("/user/:id", function (req, res) {
  res.send("user " + req.params.id);
});
```

But you could just as well have:

```ts
app.get("/user/:id", function (request, response) {
  response.send("user " + request.params.id);
});
```

The `req` object is an enhanced version of Deno's own request object and supports all [built-in fields and methods](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/http/mod.ts#ServerRequest).

### Properties

#### req.app

This property holds a reference to the instance of the Opine application that is using the middleware.

If you follow the pattern in which you create a module that just exports a middleware function and dynamic `import()` it in your main file, then the middleware can access the Opine instance via `req.app`

For example:

```ts
// index.ts
app.get("/xpoweredbyenabled", (await import("./myMiddleware.ts")).myMiddleware);
```

```ts
// myMiddleware.ts
export const myMiddleware = function (req: any, res: any) {
  res.send("'X-Powered-By' header enabled: " + req.app.get("x-powered-by"));
};
```

#### req.baseUrl

The URL path on which a router instance was mounted.

The `req.baseUrl` property is similar to the `mountpath` property of the `app` object, except `app.mountpath` returns the matched path pattern(s).

For example:

```ts
const greet = Router();

greet.get("/jp", function (req, res) {
  console.log(req.baseUrl); // /greet
  res.send("Konichiwa!");
});

app.use("/greet", greet); // load the router on '/greet'
```

Even if you use a path pattern or a set of path patterns to load the router, the `baseUrl` property returns the matched string, not the pattern(s). In the following example, the `greet` router is loaded on two path patterns.

```ts
app.use(["/gre+t", "/hel{2}o"], greet); // load the router on '/gre+t' and '/hel{2}o'
```

When a request is made to `/greet/jp`, `req.baseUrl` is "/greet". When a request is made to `/hello/jp`, `req.baseUrl` is "/hello".

#### req.body

Contains the data submitted in the request body. By default the `req.body` is a `Deno.Reader`, and needs to be read using a body-parsing middleware such as [`json()`](./bodyParser.md) or [`urlencoded()`](./bodyParser.md).

The following example shows how to use body-parsing middleware to populate `req.parsedBody`. _Note:_ this is one way Opine differs from Express due to `req.body` being a protected property in Deno.

```ts
import {
  opine,
  json,
  urlencoded,
} from "https://deno.land/x/opine@master/mod.ts";

const app = opine();

app.use(json()); // for parsing application/json
app.use(urlencoded(); // for parsing application/x-www-form-urlencoded

app.post("/profile", function (req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.parsedBody);
  res.json(req.parsedBody);
});
```

The following example shows how to implement your own simple body-parsing middleware to transform `req.parsedBody` into a raw string:

```ts
import opine from "https://deno.land/x/opine@master/mod.ts";

const app = opine();

const bodyParser = async function (req, res, next) {
  const rawBody = await Deno.readAll(req.body);
  const decodedBody = decoder.decode(rawBody);

  (req as any).parsedBody = decodedBody;
};

app.use(bodyParser);

app.post("/profile", function (req, res, next) {
  console.log(req.parsedBody);
  res.send(req.parsedBody);
});
```

#### req.fresh

When the response is still "fresh" in the client's cache `true` is returned, otherwise `false` is returned to indicate that the client cache is now stale and the full response should be sent.

When a client sends the `Cache-Control: no-cache` request header to indicate an end-to-end reload request, this module will return `false` to make handling these requests transparent.

Further details for how cache validation works can be found in the [HTTP/1.1 Caching Specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234).

```ts
console.dir(req.fresh);
// => true
```

#### req.method

Contains a string corresponding to the HTTP method of the request: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and so on.

#### req.originalUrl

> `req.url` is not a native Opine property, it is inherited from Deno's [http module](https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/http/mod.ts#ServerRequest).

This property is much like `req.url`; however, it retains the original request URL, allowing you to rewrite `req.url` freely for internal routing purposes. For example, the "mounting" feature of `app.use()` will rewrite `req.url` to strip the mount point.

```ts
// GET /search?q=something
console.dir(req.originalUrl);
// => '/search?q=something'
```

In a middleware function, `req.originalUrl` is a combination of `req.baseUrl` and `req.path`, as shown in the following example.

```ts
app.use("/admin", function (req, res, next) {
  // GET 'http://www.example.com/admin/new'
  console.dir(req.originalUrl); // '/admin/new'
  console.dir(req.baseUrl); // '/admin'
  console.dir(req.path); // '/new'
  next();
});
```

#### req.params

This property is an object containing properties mapped to the named route "parameters". For example, if you have the route `/user/:name`, then the "name" property is available as `req.params.name`. This object defaults to `{}`.

```ts
// GET /user/tj
console.dir(req.params.name);
// => 'tj'
```

When you use a regular expression for the route definition, capture groups are provided in the array using `req.params[n]`, where `n` is the n<sup>th</sup> capture group. This rule is applied to unnamed wild card matches with string routes such as `/file/*`:

```ts
// GET /file/javascripts/jquery.js
console.dir(req.params[0]);
// => 'javascripts/jquery.js'
```

Any changes made to the `req.params` object in a middleware or route handler will be reset.

> NOTE: Opine automatically decodes the values in `req.params` (using `decodeURIComponent`).

#### req.path

Contains the path part of the request URL.

```ts
// example.com/users?sort=desc
console.dir(req.path);
// => '/users'
```

> When called from a middleware, the mount point is not included in `req.path`. See [app.use()](./application.md#appusepath-callback--callback) for more details.

#### req.query

This property is an object containing a property for each query string parameter in the route.

> As `req.query`'s shape is based on user-controlled input, all properties and values in this object are untrusted and should be validated before trusting. For example, `req.query.foo.toString()` may fail in multiple ways, for example `foo` may not be there or may not be a string, and `toString` may not be a function and instead a string or other user-input.

```ts
// GET /search?q=deno+land
console.dir(req.query.q);
// => 'deno land'

// GET /shoes?order=desc&shoe[color]=blue&shoe[type]=converse
console.dir(req.query.order);
// => 'desc'

console.dir(req.query.shoe.color);
// => 'blue'

console.dir(req.query.shoe.type);
// => 'converse'

// GET /shoes?color[]=blue&color[]=black&color[]=red
console.dir(req.query.color);
// => ['blue', 'black', 'red']
```

#### req.route

Contains the currently-matched route, a string. For example:

```ts
app.get("/user/:id?", function userIdHandler(req, res) {
  console.log(req.route);
  res.send("GET");
});
```

Example output from the previous snippet:

```console
{ path: '/user/:id?',
  stack:
   [ { handle: [Function: userIdHandler],
       name: 'userIdHandler',
       params: undefined,
       path: undefined,
       keys: [],
       regexp: /^\/?$/i,
       method: 'get' } ],
  methods: { get: true } }
```

### Methods

#### req.get(field)

Returns the specified HTTP request header field (case-insensitive match). The `Referrer` and `Referer` fields are interchangeable.

```ts
req.get("Content-Type");
// => "text/plain"

req.get("content-type");
// => "text/plain"

req.get("Something");
// => undefined
```
